            The Holidays are near…and, as a special service, our school is hosting a Lil’ Shopper’s Shoppe®. Children
            will have the opportunity to pick out their own inexpensive, high quality gifts for family and friends.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-zinc-500">
            The Lil’ Shopper’s Shoppe® is a program designed for children to shop on their own at school, in a safe,
            non-commercial environment. They can learn to budget their money and spend wisely, while also experiencing
            the “Joy Of Giving”.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-zinc-500">
            The Lil’ Shopper’s Shoppe® will be set up in the school and will be run by parent and grandparent
            volunteers. Gifts are priced for a child’s budget, ranging from $0.25 to $12.00, with most priced under
            $5.00. There are gifts available for ALL the members of your Lil’ Shopper’s family.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-zinc-500">
            Gift Certificates are available and a great option if you prefer to use a credit card instead of sending
            your child to school with cash. In addition, you can email family members to sponsor your child. A
            sponsor/family member may purchase the gift certificate online and have it emailed back to your child to use
            at the holiday shop.

                        still valid and will be honored at the school.
